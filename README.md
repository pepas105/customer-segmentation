## Overview

This project applies **unsupervised learning techniques** to identify distinct customer segments from online retail data. The workflow mimics a real-world data science process: cleaning and preparing data, engineering meaningful features, evaluating clustering models, and interpreting segment characteristics to drive actionable business insights.

## Objectives

* Preprocess and clean transactional retail data.
* Create RFM features to quantify customer behavior.
* Apply **K-Means** and compare it with alternative clustering methods (e.g., GMM).
* Evaluate clusters using **Silhouette Score** and **Davies–Bouldin Index**.
* Visualize and interpret the main customer segments.

## Tools

* **Python:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
* **Jupyter Notebook:** for exploration, preprocessing, and modelling
* **GitHub:** for version control and project documentation

## Expected Results

By the end of this project, the repository will include:

* Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
* Modular modelling notebook
* Concise summary of customer segment characteristics
